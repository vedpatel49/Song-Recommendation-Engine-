# Song-Recommendation-Engine

A content based recommendation engine was built using the Spotify Playlist (https://zenodo.org/record/2594557#.X8kZXM1KjtS) and tracks datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks). 
Locality Sensitivity Hashing techniques were used to recommend songs/playlist to users. The recommendation engine was built using the PySpark API and trained on Spark clusters.

Three recommendation models were built based on different application
1) User Artist Recommendation - Recommending new artists to users
2) User Song Recommendation - Recommending new songs to users
3) Playlist Song Recommendation - Recommendaing new songs to existing playlists
