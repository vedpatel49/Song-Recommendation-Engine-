# Song-Recommendation-Engine

A content based recommendation engine was built using the Spotify Playlist (https://zenodo.org/record/2594557#.X8kZXM1KjtS) and tracks datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks). Locality Sensitivity Hashing techniques were used to recommend songs/playlist to users. The recommendation engine was built using the PySpark API and trained on Spark clusters.
